# Task

Build a system that automatically creates and maintains tests so developers can stay focused on product work.

# Problems we address

- High-quality tests are increasingly valuable as AI can produce implementation code on demand.
  - Code can be regenerated quickly for only the token cost.
  - Shifting stacks, libraries, or vendors is easier when tests capture the expected behavior.
  - Test quality shows in how quickly an implementation can be derived from the tests.
- Requirements change constantly, and tests translate them into a structured, measurable language.
  - Test-driven development helps teams converge on a shared understanding of the specification.
- New features can break critical existing functionality.
  - An automated test suite provides confidence that shipped code hits the quality bar.
- Refactoring for maintainability carries the risk of regressions.
  - Refactoring without supporting tests is slow and risky.

## Out of scope
- Busywork handed down by managers or leads that developers must complete for promotion.
  - Writing tests can sometimes be used to satisfy that pressure, though the real value may be questionable and the time cost significant.
