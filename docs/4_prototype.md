# Prototype Implementation

The "Build a very small solution" step from the planning phase was implemented as a Makefile-based automation system that leverages AI-powered test generation tools. The prototype uses OpenAI Codex CLI to automatically generate tests for target repositories, with the following key components:

- **Repository Management**: Makefile target `make repos` clones specified GitHub repositories from `evals/github_repos.yaml`
- **Test Generation**: Makefile target `make run` executes Codex CLI with the latest prompt on each repository to generate comprehensive test suites
- **Result Collection**: Makefile target `make collect` gathers generated documentation and artifacts into timestamped directories

This minimal viable solution demonstrates automated test generation in 1-2 hours of setup, focusing on Python applications with coverage-driven test creation using AI prompts from the `prompts/` directory.
