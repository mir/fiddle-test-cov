### Conventional Solutions
Conventional tools focus on algorithmic approaches without heavy AI reliance.
For instance, model-based testing tools like GraphWalker and Spec Explorer generate tests from behavioral models, enabling systematic coverage of system states.
Search-based tools such as EvoSuite use genetic algorithms to evolve test suites for Java, optimizing for criteria like branch coverage.
Symbolic execution tools like KLEE automatically generate inputs to explore code paths in C/C++ programs, achieving high coverage but limited by computational complexity in large systems.
These tools provide strong foundations for regression testing and refactoring but often demand manual refinement for real-world applicability.

AI-driven tools automate test authoring and self-healing.
mabl's Test Creation Agent builds tests from natural language requirements, reducing maintenance through visual AI adaptations.
testRigor enables plain-English test generation, minimizing upkeep by adapting to UI changes and achieving 90%+ coverage.
Applitools focuses on visual testing with AI for end-to-end automation, cutting maintenance by 4x.
Testim uses ML locators for stable tests, integrating with CI/CD for scalability.
Startups like Qodo and Diffblue emphasize code-based generation, though broader adoption in 2025 may hinge on addressing integration costs.
