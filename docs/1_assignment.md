# Coverage-driven Test Generation

## Overview
Writing and maintaining tests are crucial for any software project, but they are often avoided due to their tedious nature.  
In this test assignment, you will attempt to solve this problem by building a system that generates/maintains tests automatically, allowing developers to focus on business tasks.

## First Milestone
The problem is intentionally stated very broadly. To focus the direction of your work, we suggest the first starting point:
- **Target**: Single user-facing app (CLI, web app, etc.) written in Python
- **Tools**: Coding agent and coverage tool of your choice
- **Solution**: A CLI app that, when launched on a target codebase, generates new or adjusts existing tests to push coverage to a reasonable maximum.
- **Assumption**: When new tests are generated, you can assume that the production behavior is correct.

## Further Steps
After achieving the first milestone, you’re free to choose further directions to explore and implement in your solution.  
Your main guidance in that choice should be: *“What can I do to make my solution more useful in real life?”*  
Explaining your thought process on this decision (as well as describing plans for your work as if it were a real task) is a part of the test assignment, equally important to the code itself.

## Process
Provide:
- Link to .git repository with your code.
- Demo of your solution: sample target project(s) + results of tests generation with your app.
- Optionally, any other content that helps you to showcase your work and/or thought process.

We don’t have a strict deadline for your solution, but we expect you to put no more than 16 working hours into your solution.  
If you’re really eager to continue with it after 16 hours, you’re free to do so, but please indicate the milestone achieved in 16 hours explicitly.
