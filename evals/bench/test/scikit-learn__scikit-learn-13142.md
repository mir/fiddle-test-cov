## Problem Statement

GaussianMixture predict and fit_predict disagree when n_init>1
#### Description
When `n_init` is specified in GaussianMixture, the results of fit_predict(X) and predict(X) are often different.  The `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` unit test doesn't catch this because it does not set `n_init`.

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
```
python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
from sklearn.utils.testing import assert_array_equal
import numpy
X = numpy.random.randn(1000,5)
print 'no n_init'
gm = GaussianMixture(n_components=5)
c1 = gm.fit_predict(X)
c2 = gm.predict(X)
assert_array_equal(c1,c2)
print 'n_init=5'
gm = GaussianMixture(n_components=5, n_init=5)
c1 = gm.fit_predict(X)
c2 = gm.predict(X)
assert_array_equal(c1,c2)
```

#### Expected Results
```
no n_init
n_init=5
```
No exceptions.

#### Actual Results
```
no n_init
n_init=5

## Hints

Indeed the code in fit_predict and the one in predict are not exactly consistent. This should be fixed but we would need to check the math to choose the correct variant, add a test and remove the other one.
I don't think the math is wrong or inconsistent.  I think it's a matter of `fit_predict` returning the fit from the last of `n_iter` iterations, when it should be returning the fit from the _best_ of the iterations.  That is, the last call to `self._e_step()` (base.py:263) should be moved to just before the return, after `self._set_parameters(best_params)` restores the best solution.
Seems good indeed. When looking quickly you can miss the fact that `_e_step` uses the parameters even if not passed as arguments because they are attributes of the estimator. That's what happened to me :)

 Would you submit a PR ?
